# 👋 🙋‍♂️ there !

Welcome! It's nice to have you here. Enjoy what you see or leave me an issue as comment. 😇 

## About ndrslmpk
My motto is, and always was, to _never stop learning_. I think that life is too short to let you dictate limits🚧🛑⛔, just because you never tried. Do it. Let your interests' complexity become your 🚀motivation, not your 🙉🙇‍excuse .

I'm always curious meeting 🔥 like-minded 🧑‍🚀 who want to 🛠️ something 🌎. Currently, I'm trying out a Flutter-Flask-🥪 and look for an opportunity to contribute to an Open-Source project. 

Last but not least, I’m working on a 📱 app to help people with 🧠 disorders. So, in fact you want to be a part of this voluntary journey, 🔫 me a message! 

Let's become real 🦸 for others. 🫶 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
